<h1>CONCEPT</h1>
<p>Inspired by her time dining and working at a cafe in Postwick that no longer exists, Leah set off to open her own with the goal of recreating the unique experience for both people as well as Pokemon. Pokemon Cafe is a kissaten that offers a wide selection of cute as well as delectable sweets, meals and drinks. Every offering from Pokemon Cafe is inspired by beloved Pokemon patrons of the cafe and meticulously crafted with care. At Pokemon Cafe, we aim to create an inviting atmosphere and give customers an unforgettable time.
